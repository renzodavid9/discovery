# Discovery - remote scripts runner.

This project is a system to run any script in remote machines, and take the output of those scripts and send it to a dashboard. Some ideas of where to use it:
* IoT: making able to run any process in different devices and track it in a central place.
* Workloads distribution: splitting a problem in smaller pieces and running it in different devices connected in an network.
